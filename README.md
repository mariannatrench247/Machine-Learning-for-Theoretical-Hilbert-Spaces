#Machine Learning for Theoretical Hilbert Spaces

Here is an introduction: 

Machine Learning in Hilbert Spaces
Marianna Belmares


This project was a theoretical attempt to isolate quantum phenomena, particular protons and how they interacted with varying EM fields through different charges. This is to create renewable energy decomposing and rebuilding protons to create an endless supply of energy with minimal cost and materials. 

How To: 

1. Create Prototype for EM Field Generator
    - inevitable Generator will have multiple rotating rings
    - measure QM phenomena
    - find/make device that can measure fluctuations

2. Use ML network to
   - monitor QM fluctuations, studying protons first, half spin, momentum, etc
   - ML model to predict which charges in field generator must be maintained to produce steady state proton annilation/reconstruction
   - Use model to predict how to create a steady state energetic throughput
  
3. Stabilize
   -    EM generator for these proton configurations
   -    maintain steady state energetic output
   -    use cases for energy
  
4. Considerations
    - Quantum Field Theories
    - Additional Subatomic particle interactions (neutrinos, bosons, etc).

5. Additional study cases
    - Black Opal - learn more quantum computing.

Readying Protons for EM Field generator 
    - why Protons?

    - How to Isolate Protons? 
        - Hydrogen (1 proton/1 electron). Strong Electric Field will split electron off from proton
    - Hydrogen Gas 
        - pump energy into gas to ionise it. Once hydrogen gas is ionized, there will be free protons & electrons 
        - separate protons & electrons using magnetic field

    * Jochen Walz 

    1. shoot electrons at substance which release protons (then are trapped using magnets)
    2. Let Proton escape until one left - magnet causes lone proton to precess at frequency that depends on G-Factor 
    3. Deduce frequency using radiowaves - radiowavs flipped orientations of proton's magnet only when frequnces matches precession frequency
