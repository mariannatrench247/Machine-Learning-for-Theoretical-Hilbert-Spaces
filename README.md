#Machine Learning for Theoretical Hilbert Spaces

Here is an introduction: 

Machine Learning in Hilbert Spaces

This project was a theoretical attempt to isolate quantum phenomena, particular protons and how they interacted with varying EM fields through different charges. This is to create renewable energy decomposing and rebuilding protons to create an endless supply of energy with minimal cost and materials. 

How To: 

1. Create Prototype for EM Field Generator
    - inevitable Generator will have multiple rotating rings
    - measure QM phenomena
    - find/make device that can measure fluctuations

2. Use ML network to
   - monitor QM fluctuations, studying protons first, half spin, momentum, etc
   - ML model to predict which charges in field generator must be maintained to produce steady state proton annilation/reconstruction
   - Use model to predict how to create a steady state energetic throughput
  
3. Stabilize
   -    EM generator for these proton configurations
   -    maintain steady state energetic output
   -    use cases for energy
  
4. Considerations
    - Quantum Field Theories
    - Additional Subatomic particle interactions (neutrinos, bosons, etc).

5. Additional study cases
    - Black Opal - learn more quantum computing.
