#Machine Learning for Theoretical Hilbert Spaces

Here is an introduction: 

Machine Learning in Hilbert Spaces
Marianna Belmares


This project was a theoretical attempt to isolate quantum phenomena, particular protons and how they interacted with varying EM fields through different charges. This is to create renewable energy decomposing and rebuilding protons to create an endless supply of energy with minimal cost and materials. 

Protoypes: 
Infancy phase 1: 
Electromagnetic Field Generator( Rudimentary)
